# RCA_VA_Med_Appointment_Delays
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of Delays in Appointment times in VA medical facilities. I use Random Forrest Model to find the most important factor causing delays in appointments. The primary data was collecting from veterans across the country, and the secondary data came from publically available sources on va.gov about VA centers.
