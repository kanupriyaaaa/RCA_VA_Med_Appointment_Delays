# RCA_VA_Med_Appointment_Delays
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of delays in getting medical appointment in VA medical facilities. As depicted in file "Primary_Data_analysis", I used Random Forrest Model to determined the most important factor causing longer wait times for getting appointments. The primary data was collecting from veterans across the country via online an survey, and the secondary data came from publically available sources on va.gov about VA centers. I used the secondary data to determine the percentage of times booking an appointment took longer than 30 days to see a pattern of delays in different facilities corresponding with different regional RUCA and Zip codes. 
In the end, the model suggest that the "phone appointment system" used by the VA is the most important cause of delays. In particular, veterans have to call on a given number to confirm their appointment and the automated call is not supported with proper mechanism to book appointments based on the location, time, and severity.
